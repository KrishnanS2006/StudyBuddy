  Helping students all around the world manage their school life in a fun and easy way!
## Inspiration
  Our goal was to create a Discord bot that could help teachers and students manage their classwork. The goal was to provide a way for users to create a class, and add and view upcoming assignments and exams.
## What it does
  This bot allows a user to create a class by providing a name, description, and teacher name to the Discord bot. Users can add themselves to the class, and can view assignments and exams by simply providing a command in Discord.
## How we built it
  We used Discord.py to construct the bot using Python. We worked together using replit in order to collaborate virtually, and employed mySQL for database management. We divided tasks according to our repective areas of expertise, and the amount of time we estimated that we would need for each section.
## Challenges we ran into
  The mySQL table was difficult to work with, in part due to the virtual nature of the project, and we definitely had a lot of work to do in a fairly constrained timeframe. Despite these challenges, we were able to present a fucntional demo of the project, and in the end, finish the project to our satisfaction. 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
  We created a very user friendly bot that is highly stable, and fulfills out desired functionalities, in spite of the challenges that come with working virtually as opposed to in-person teamwork.
## What we learned
  We learned a lot about using Discord.py, teamwork skills, and the allotment of responsibilities.
## What's next for StudyBuddy
  We will be interested in adding additional functionalities to StudyBuddy, such as keeping track of grades, pinpointing areas in which students can improve, and more!
