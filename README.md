# StudyBuddy
  Helping students all around the world manage their school life in a fun and easy way!
## Inspiration
  Our goal was to create a Discord bot that could help teachers and students manage their classwork. The goal was to provide a way for users to create a class, and add and view upcoming assignments and exams.
## What it does
  This bot allows a user to create a class by providing a name, description, and teacher name to the Discord bot. Users can add themselves to the class, and can view assignments and exams by simply providing a command in Discord.
## How we built it
  We used Discord.py to construct the bot. We worked together using replit, and employed mySQL for database management.
## Challenges we ran into
  The mySQL table was difficult to work with, and we definately had a lot of work to do in a fairly constrained timeframe.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
  We created a very user friendly bot that is highly stable, and fulfills out desired functionalities.
## What we learned
  We learned a lot about using Discord.py, teamwork skills, and the allotment of responsibilities.
## What's next for StudyBuddy
  We will be interested in adding additional funcationalities to StudyBuddy, such as keeping track of grades, pinpointing areas in which students can improve, and more!
